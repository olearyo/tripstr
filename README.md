# Tripstr

The ultimate travel management app.

## Getting Started

This was our first group project for our web development & design course whilst studying Interactive Media Mangement at Sheridan College. The idea behind it is quite simple and universal: planning a holiday is stressful! There are so many booking information, details & tickets spread accross multiple platforms, emails and accounts. Tripstr tries to simplify that aspect of travelling by having documents, flights, transportation & accomodation in one spot. 

### Process

As part of our course, we worked on the brainstorming, research & user testing before creating our project. 

```
User flow & research
Style guide & wireframes
Prototypes
Initial Dev
User Testing
Complete working application
```

### Functionality

Since this was our first group web development project, we weren't allowed to use frameworks so we could get a firm grasp on the basics. These are the languages we learnt & implemented to create Tripstr:

PHP & PDO for server-side
MYSQL for database interactions with PHPMyAdmin
HTML & CSS 
Vanilla Javascript to create more interactivity, such as: popups, navigation and date-time picker.
AJAX to collect information & arrange from the database.
